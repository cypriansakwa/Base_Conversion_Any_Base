This Rust program allows you to convert numbers between different bases. 
The conversion accepts both fractional and integer components of the number. 
The program converts a number from one base to another by first reading it in the supplied base, then converting it to decimal, and finally to the target base. 
It can handle both positive and negative numbers.
